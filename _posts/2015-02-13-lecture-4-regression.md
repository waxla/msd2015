In this lecture we transitioned from obtaining and exploring
data to modeling data. 

First we set the context, distinguishing
among unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and reinforcement
learning. Within supervised learning, we distinguished classification
from regression, and then discussed regression, including regularization.
